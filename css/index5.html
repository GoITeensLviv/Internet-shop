Apple IPhone X 64GB	- 
"This is the future for the next 10 years" - so presented the anniversary, tenth version of iPhone, Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. The iPhone X has captured the most interesting and unusual developments of the company. First of all it concerns the appearance of a smartphone. Frameless display with rounded corners equipped with a smartphone is not a unique feature, but now we will see many such smartphones in the near future.
